Front End Project: "The Art Curator"

Curate pieces of art from various museums in one place & be able to see / search via different categories (i.e. artist, art style, art era, etc.). 

As we progress on the project we will be able to prove a more in depth outline of the project. 

The overall goal is to query different API's to showcase pieces of art and be able to provide the following information:
- Artwork Title
- Name of the Artist 
- Creation Year
- Medium (oil on cavas, watercolor, statue, etc.)
- Dimensions
- Location (The Museum it's currently at or the Museum that is housing it in its online catalog)
