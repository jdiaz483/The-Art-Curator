The Art Curator 

About The Project:

The project houses the collection of four different museums;
- The Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, IL, USA
- The Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, OH, USA
- The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands
- The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen, Denmark 

The goal for this project was to allow one to see, search, and appreciate the artworks these museums hold from the comfort of your own home. 
In housing these four different museums in one place, it eliminates having to go back and forth between the websites of the museums and figuring out how to see the artworks on their page. The art pieces showcased within each museum gallery is also in the public domain, meaning it is no longer under its copyright. This means that if you wanted your own print, you can go to the museum's page and download a copy (so long as you're not trying to make money off of them). 

Usage: 
- The Art Curator pulls from 4 different API's; one per gallery. Each API is providing all the information that is being rendered in each page - the image of the artwork as well as the name of the artist and the year(s) it was created. 
- You have the ability to click on the image and have a higher resolution version pop up via a modal.
