## About The Project


## Usage 
The Art Curator uses four different API's from four different museums:

- [The Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/) in *Chicago, IL, USA*
- [The Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) in *Cleveland, OH, USA*
- [The Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en) in *Amsterdam, NE, EU*
- [The National Gallery of Art](https://www.smk.dk/en/) in *Coppenhagen, DE, EU*

From these four museums, The Art Curator displays the following information:
- An image of the artwork (via the preview and the modal)
- The name of the artwork
- The year(s) in which it was created
- The name of the artist the artwork is attributed to

The Art Curator allows you to search by the name of the artwork or the name of an artist. If you don't know the name of the artwork or the name of the artist but know that the art piece you are looking for depicts, for example, flowers, you can enter the word flowers in the search bar and The Art Curator will pull all images in which the word flowers is a keyword (whether the word is in the title, a part of the artist's name or a keyword related to the art piece).
